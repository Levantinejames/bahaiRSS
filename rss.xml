Yet another fruit thereof hath disclosed that which captivated the heart of Muḥammad, the Apostle of God, Who, carried away by the sweet accents of the Voice from on high, ascended unto the Divine Lote-Tree and heard, proceeding from within the Tabernacle of majesty, the Voice of God speaking forth the mystery of My hallowed, My exalted and mighty Name.</p><p><em>Source:</em> tablets-for-the-occasion-of-the-birth-of-the-bab-and-bahaullah.pdf</p>]]></description>
